Goals
=====

Compare code produced by cc65, 6502-gcc, and vbcc

Each with different optim flags, compare code's size and number of cycles used for different examples.

Examples to have:
 - Some CPU intensive task: should show ability to produce nice low-level code
 - Some complex code structure: should show ability to optimize high-level code
